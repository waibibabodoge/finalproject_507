Since the dataset of more than 7000 images are too large for the github, I have uploaded the dataset for the project to google drive and searched for a way to download it directly. If that doesn't work, I also included the link to the dataset here:https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/ The code is using my local path of the file so that need to be changed.
The image annotations is under annotations, trainval.txt
The image is under folder images
